# Notebook
A simple program to create and edit text files. It also has an encrypted format. *

## *IMPORTANT: SECURITY NOTE
In version 1.0-SNAPSHOT, the encrypted format has a potential security vulnerability
that allows code to be injected into the file. If a file is tampered with, it can
execute malicious code when the file is opened. DO NOT open an encrypted file created
or edited by someone else.
