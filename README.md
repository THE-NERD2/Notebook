# Notebook
A simple program to create and edit text files. It also has an encrypted format. *

## *IMPORTANT: SECURITY NOTE
In version 1.0-SNAPSHOT, the encrypted format has a potential security vulnerability
that allows code to be injected into the file. If a file is tampered with, it can
execute malicious code when the file is opened. DO NOT open an encrypted file created
or edited by someone else.

## IMPORTANT: ARCHIVE NOTICE
This project is a little terrible. All the code is super bad quality, and it has a
major security issue. I don't want to deal with my past terrible code style, so this
project is to be archived in favor of [THE-NERD2/Notebook2](https://github.com/THE-NERD2/Notebook2)
